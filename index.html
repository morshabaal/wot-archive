    <h1>Welcome to the World of Tibia archive!</h1>
    <p>This website contains an archive of <strong>129,399</strong> forum posts, from <strong>14,071</strong> forum threads. This archive was made by using the CDX API from the Internet Archive ("Wayback Machine"). The URL used was "tibia.gamigo.de". World of Tibia used many different domains, such as "tibia.de" and "tibia.looki.de". Because of convenience, I kept to the "tibia.gamigo.de" domain and I found it had the most archived content.</p>
    <p>The "World of Tibia archive" was made by <strong>cyph3rjo3/morshabaal</strong> on 31st of March 2024.</p>
